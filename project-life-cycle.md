# Project Capture Document for BYUI Canvas Theme and JS
#### *Author: Emma Fisher*

## Background
Canvas does not provide all the customization we need when it comes to styling things like accordions, generating a homepage, and adding
a copyright footer. So, Canvas allows us to upload a CSS and JS file that allows us to add custom code for the needs of instructors and
students. This project includes a repo that holds the CSS and JS files which are minified using gulp before being uploaded to Canvas.

-----

## Objectives
- It should give accordions functionality
- It should give tabs functionality
- It should initialize dialog boxes
- It should add standardized tags to all videos
- It should create a homepage with buttons that link to each week's module and some other information
- It should alter the breadcrumb whne on a page so it shows the previous page as the Modules page
- It should alter the appearance of code to have a dark background and colorized elements
- It should add a copyright footer to every page (except the speed grader page)
- It should add a tooltip to the quizzes.next button in settings
- It should inject CSS into the Canvas WYSIWYG editor
- It should make the course navigation sticky on the page
- It should load Open Sans font
- Activity banners?
- Positioning and Sizing?
- Captions for images?

# Requirements

### Input Requirements

#### Source of Inputs

The only inputs for this project are requests for fixes made by Corey or others. There are no inputs into the project, only requests made
by stakeholders and our response to the requests in the form of updates.

#### Definition of Inputs

None.

### Output Requirements
#### Destination

The outputs are the JS and CSS files created that will need to be directly uploaded to Canvas. You will first need to test the changes in
the Canvas test environment. To get permission to access the test environment, contact Dane Bohman. It can then be tested in Canvas prod
in the Development subaccount. You can use the Chrome extension Resource Override to stop Development from running the JS file in the
top level so you can really see what the code will do. Then, Dane needs to be contacted to approve the changes and upload it to Canvas
prod.

#### Definition of Outputs

Changes in the LMS:
- JS file upload in BYUI prod is changed
- CSS file upload in BYUI prod is changed
Keep in mind, these changes will affect all Canvas users, so the code needs to be thoroughly tested and approves before being uploaded
here.

### Interface

#### Type: Top-level Canvas File
