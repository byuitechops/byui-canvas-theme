## How to Test in the test instance of Canvas

Uploading to BYUI theme trickles down to Development, Online, and any other subaccounts, so the files need only be uploaded to the top level (BYU-Idaho).

Upload the updated JS and CSS files to the test instance of Canvas as a new theme
* Open a web page in the test instance of Canvas
* Click Admin > BYU-Idaho > Themes
* Click the button in the top right corner labeled '+Theme' and choose the name of the current theme
* Under the Upload tab, select the new file(s) you want to upload, then preview your changes
* Save theme and rename it to include the current date and your name
* Apply theme

You can now observe how your changes affect the look and functionality of Canvas
